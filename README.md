> A game with octocats!

## How to play

You are an octocat in the game (specifically a [Jetpacktocat](https://octodex.github.com/jetpacktocat/)), a little character. You need to **click the mouse**, press the  key, or tap (touch screen devices) to levitate, otherwise the octocat will descend. If she hits the top or bottom boundaries that'll end the game.

There will be some obstacles along the way like **forks**, **branches** and some **enemies** who are also known as _pakias_. There are 3 types of pakias (which are actually other octocats as well):


 - sad (pull you)
 - happy (push you)
 - angry (kill you)


Keep safe distance from them (especially from the angry ones)!

There are some collectibles too! Coins for points (yellow for 50, pink for 100, red for 500). [Topguntocat](https://octodex.github.com/topguntocat/)s for invincibility for a short period. [Socialite](https://octodex.github.com/socialite/) cats will spawn clones that'll destroy anything that comes in their way!

Hit the <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Spacebar</kbd> keys to (re)start the game.

## About

This HTML5 Game (OctoPakia) has been happily _changed_ for the [Github's Game Off 2015 (_The Game Has Changed_)](https://github.com/blog/1972-the-game-has-changed).

## Credits

 - This game was initially named _Pappu Pakia_ and it was created by [Rishabh](https://twitter.com/_rishabhp) and [Kushagra](https://twitter.com/solitarydesigns). Thanks to [Rezoner](http://rezoner.net/) for Music.
 - [IonicaBizau](https://twitter.com/IonicaBizau) changed it by replacing the sprites into [Octocats designed by GitHubbers](http://octodex.github.com). Also the interface was enhanced by using [Primer](http://primercss.io/) and [Octicons](https://octicons.github.com/).
 - All other sounds produced by personal thingies like mouths, hands and books. Some tricks and tips that we learnt while making this game has been shared on [CodeTheory](http://codetheory.in) and [CSSDeck](http://cssdeck.com/codecasts).

## :sparkling_heart: Support my projects

I open-source almost everything I can, and I try to reply everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously,
this takes time. You can integrate and use these projects in your applications *for free*! You can even change the source code and redistribute (even resell it).

However, if you get some profit from this or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, there are few ways you can do it:

 - Starring and sharing the projects you like :rocket:
 - [![PayPal][badge_paypal]][paypal-donations]—You can make one-time donations via PayPal. I'll probably buy a ~~coffee~~ tea. :tea:
 - [![Support me on Patreon][badge_patreon]][patreon]—Set up a recurring monthly donation and you will get interesting news about what I'm doing (things that I don't share with everyone).
 - **Bitcoin**—You can send me bitcoins at this address (or scanning the code below): `1P9BRsmazNQcuyTxEqveUsnf5CERdq35V6`
